# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build production app: `npm run build`
- Start production server: `npm run start`
- Lint repository: `npm run lint`
- Lint one file: `npx eslint src/components/Navbar.tsx`
- Lint multiple files: `npx eslint src/app/page.tsx src/app/api/contact/route.ts`

## Tests

There is currently no test runner configured.

- No `test` script exists in `package.json`
- No Jest / Vitest / Playwright / Cypress config is present
- No single-test command exists yet

For meaningful changes, use:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript (`strict: true`)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Framer Motion for animation
- next-themes for dark mode
- Radix/shadcn-style UI primitives under `src/components/ui`
- Resend for contact email delivery
- LLM-backed “AI Twin” chat via `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

## Architecture

### App shell

- `src/app/layout.tsx` owns global metadata, viewport config, JSON-LD injection, theme bootstrapping, skip link, and wraps the app with `SmoothScroll` and `Providers`.
- `src/app/providers.tsx` configures class-based theming via `next-themes` and mounts the global Sonner toaster.
- `src/app/page.tsx` is intentionally compositional: it stitches together the landing-page sections plus the floating AI chat.

### Content model

The portfolio is mostly data-driven.

- `src/data/portfolio.ts` is the source of truth for personal info, experience, projects, skills, stats, and initial AI chat suggestions.
- Multiple parts of the app derive from this file: visible homepage sections, contact links, AI twin context, and SEO metadata.
- When updating resume links, social links, project entries, or career facts, start here and then verify any dependent SEO/chat behavior.

### SEO and metadata

SEO is centralized rather than scattered across sections.

- `src/lib/seo/site.ts` defines canonical site metadata, keywords, geo info, and identity fields.
- `src/lib/seo/jsonld.ts` builds the schema graph for Website, WebPage, Person, and project list entries.
- `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, and `src/app/robots.ts` consume that SEO layer.

### Homepage composition

The homepage is a single long-form landing page with section-based navigation.

- `Navbar` scrolls to hash sections and tracks the active section in view.
- Most visible sections (`HeroSection`, `AboutSection`, `ExperienceSection`, `ProjectsSection`, `SkillsSection`, `AITwinSection`, `ContactSection`) are presentation components backed by portfolio data.
- `SmoothScroll` installs Lenis globally and intercepts in-page hash navigation, so section links should use the existing scroll helpers instead of custom scrolling behavior.

### AI Twin flow

The AI Twin is the most application-like feature in the repo.

- `src/components/AITwinChat.tsx` contains the chat UI, localStorage-backed conversation persistence, retry UX, markdown rendering, suggestion chips, and mobile/desktop dialog behavior.
- `src/components/AITwinSection.tsx` is the landing-page CTA that opens the chat via a custom window event.
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` validates input, rate-limits requests, trims conversation history, calls the upstream LLM provider, and generates follow-up suggestions.
- `src/lib/ai-config.ts` contains the system prompts and model selection.
- `src/lib/ai-twin.ts` builds the portfolio knowledge context, normalizes project matching, manages stored chat history, and injects contextual links into AI responses.

Important constraint: the AI assistant is intentionally scoped to Prabhdeep's professional profile and project history. If you change portfolio data or project naming, review both the prompt context and link-generation logic.

### Contact flow

The contact form is split cleanly between client validation and server delivery.

- `src/components/ContactSection.tsx` manages the form UI, client-side validation, timeout handling, and toast feedback.
- `src/lib/contact.ts` defines the shared Zod schema and allowed contact reasons.
- `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` re-validates the payload, rate-limits submissions, builds sanitized email content, and sends via Resend.
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` provides the shared in-memory rate limiting helpers used by both API routes.

### Styling and UI primitives

- Global design tokens, cursors, utility classes, and theme variables live in `src/app/globals.css`.
- Reusable low-level primitives are in `src/components/ui/`; prefer extending those before creating new base components.
- The site relies heavily on Tailwind utility classes plus a few shared helpers like `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- Motion and reduced-motion support are already wired into key components; preserve that behavior when editing animated UI.

## Environment variables

The app currently uses these environment variables:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM`
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO`
- `AI_MODEL`
- `LLM_API_KEY`
- `LLM_BASE_URL`

## Working conventions

- Use `npm`, not another package manager.
- Prefer `@/*` imports; `tsconfig.json` maps `@/*` to `src/*`.
- Preserve the local formatting style of the file you touch; there is no Prettier config.
- Default to server components; add `"use client"` only when hooks, browser APIs, animation, or event-driven UI require it.
- For backend/API changes, keep the existing pattern of Zod validation + `NextResponse.json(...)` + explicit status codes.
- If you change runtime behavior in a meaningful way, validate with `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
